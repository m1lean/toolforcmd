# Tool For CMD | Kotlin

### Here is a simple Kotlin utility example for copying files using the command line:


## Features

- This code creates a simple web server that listens for incoming connections on port 8080. When a request is received, it sends "Hello, World!" in response. This is an extremely simple example and does not include handling of many important aspects such as HTTP header parsing, flow management, and security. In a real environment, it is recommended to use more complex HTTP-enabled libraries such as Boost.Asio, Poco, or others to create a web server.


## Installation

- Compile this code using the Kotlin compiler (kotlinc) and run the resulting .jar file passing the command line arguments:

```bash
kotlinc CopyUtility.kt -include-runtime -d CopyUtility.jar
java -jar CopyUtility.jar source.txt destination.txt
```

Note that this is a simple example and you can extend the functionality to suit your needs.
